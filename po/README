Hi,

If you would like to translate Winefish into your language,
please following instructions:


* Configure winefish from source directory:
$ autoconf # if needed
$ ./configure # or something like this
$ cd po # change to `po' directory

* In this 'po' directory, try:
$ rm -fv winefish.po; make winefish.po

* If there's already LANG.po files, please try
$ make update-po

* If not, copying winefish.po to LANG.po
$ cp winefish.po LANG.po

* Using KBabel,gTranslator,... to open the LANG.po file
and start/continue the translation.

* Please mailto your work (LANG.po) to kyanh@o2.pl.
Your contribution will be part of next minor Winefish release.

Thank you in advance for your contribution.

You make Winefish live!

Regards,

kyanh <kyanh@o2.pl>
