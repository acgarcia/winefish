running, you should*NOT* modify any files located in '~/.winefish/'

* To open a file in existing running Winefish at specific line, try:
	winefish -n0 -l<num> <filename(s)>
For example
	winefish -n0 -l 12 foobar.tex
Ff you specify multiple files, all are opened at the same line numbered <num> :)

	~/.winefish/words
	~/.winefish/words_s
	~/.winefish/autotext
You may get some good idea. Modify it as you want!
