To install Winefish from source
===============================

1) get the required libraries (header files and executable files)

 	* glib-2.0 (version >= 2.2.2)
	* libgtk2 (version >= 2.4.0)
	* libpcre
	* [ aspell ] (pptional; for spell checking)
	* [ grep, find, [ sed, xargs ]] (optional; for `advance open' functions)

2) details about `configure'

	$ sh configure --help

   if you wanna use
	--prefix=/home/myhome/apps/
   (or something like that) please take care of following options which
   relate to mime type, desktop icons, etc.

   Vietnamese TeX Users:
   	you may use `--with-unikey-gtk' ---
   	if you get troubles with Winefish + Unikey GTK.

3) for the development release (winefish-x.x.x.y),
   please excute `autoconf' to generate `configure' script

	$ autoconf

4) some variables control winefish.
   modify them in `config.h.in' (the very last lines).
   See `doc/winefihs.html#CONFIGURE' for more details

5) configure and compile

	$ sh ./configure [you-options]
	$ make

6) reduce filesize

	$ make strip # this requires `strip' program

7) install everything

	$ su
	$ make install
