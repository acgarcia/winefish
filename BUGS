======== 1.3.2-RC1

#90/fixed/kyanh/20060214/
* winefish should preserve %l or %f... 
	+ /home/users/kyanh/moss/winefish.bugs/bug_expander.html)
	+ http://winefish.berlios.de/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=2
FIXED:
	added %p (expands to percent sign)

======== 1.3.2.7a

#89/fixed/kyanh/20060212/
* disable 'autocompletion' (toggler menu: document/autocompletion) takes no effect.
FIXED: to many things

#88/fixed/kyanh/20060211/
* copy/paste a brace: it is still hilighted
FIXED: modify past_operation
But... the bug dies itself... as an effect of removing
tag when key/button press.

#87/fixed/kyanh/20060211/
* bad STORIES, see brace_finder.c :(
if there is {} then after inserting {\} the \ will be hilighted
if there is $$$ then after inserting $\$$ the \ will be hilighted
(\basckslash or any other character)
instead of inserting we may paste something between { and }s
FIXED:
	[ (brace_finder) with limit==-1 ] == [ cleanup ]
	we should remove the tags before key/button released
	THIS CAUSES THE FLASH EFFECT :(

#86/fixed/kyanh/20060211/
* brace_finder: for the dollar sign, if the extra $ isnot found, finder return BR_RET_NOT_FOUND
(even the the left $ is found)

======== 1.3.2.6

#85/fixed/kyanh/20060211/
* autocompletion: press Control+S sometimes causes popup menu to be showed
(press Control+S twice, release control after the first)
BACKTRACE:
	backtrace/snooper85.log
FIXED:
	should check for state of previous kevent -> added (main_v->last_kevent);

#84/fixed/Mich√®le Garoche/200602xx/
* missing NULL in using (g_strconcat) somewhere in wizards.c (see backtrace/winefish.diff-M-Garoche)

#83/fixed/kyanh/20060210/
* brace_finder:
	<any_code>{|%<end_of_line>
(| is the cursor). start finding brace returns BR_RET_IN_COMMENT
FIXED:
	must detect `iter_start_new' before checking for BR_RET_IN_COMMENT status.

#82/fixed/kyanh/20060210/
* LANG=fr_FR winefish
cat xxx.log when xxx.log doesnot exist -> expose invalid UTF8 string
and we see nothing in outputbox. try to set_encoding for io_channel
in outputbox_bf.c, but the result is the same. it's hard to handle!!!
* FIXED:
	use (g_locale_to_utf8) in outputbox_filter::outputbox_filter.c
	(thanks to a member of winefish-devel. now i forget his name. update soon)
 (he is Claudio Polegato Junior <cpolegatojr_lsts@pop.com.br>)

============================================================== [200601]

#81/fixed/kyanh/20060129/
* Though `default hilight == OFF', the doc_new() still turn hilight ON

#80/fixed/kyanh/20060129/
* PasteOperation: though current_document's hilight state = OFF, the regions is still hilighted
NOTE: the contents in clipboard is hilighted too :(
FIXED: document.c :: edit_paste_cb()

#79/fixed/kyanh/20060128/
* empty ~/.winefish/* ==> view line number == false :(
FIXED:
	unknown state

#78/fixed/kyanh/20060128/
* outputbox: open one file in many many tab!!
FIXED:
 	document.c: !main_v->props.view_bars & MODE_ALLOW_MULTIPLE_INSTANCE
 	== >  !(main_v->props.view_bars & MODE_ALLOW_MULTIPLE_INSTANCE)

#77/fixed/kyanh/20060127/
* hilight syntax by default , but the toggle menu Document/HilightSyntax == off
FIXED:
	document.c::doc_new():: we need set toogle menu=TRUE if hilightstat=1

#76
* reload a document should go the previous line
* winefish knows file was changed by another process only when
the document notebook/tab changed...

#75/fixed/kyanh/20060127/
* outputbox: cannot search for \begin (<== need escaping)

#74/fixed/kyanh/20060127/
* outputbox: if there is line number captured => crash.

#73
* outputbox: when starting a tool, winefish doesnot know that file was changed
by another proccess ;) this may not a bug bug a feature ;(

#72/fixed/kyanh/20060126/
* if a tool is running and we try to run another one, the outputbox's messages
are completly cleared/

#71/fixed/kyanh/20060125/
* cannot stop grepbox ;(

#70/fixed/kyanh/20060125/
* outputbox_bf.c: exit too fast. cannot capture the output sometimes

#69/fixed/kyanh/20060124/
* notebook_changed: shoule hide the popup menu (autocompletion)

#68
* wrong hilight for URLs in comments

#67/fixed/kyanh/20060123/
* Open advanced, dir=/home/users/kyanh/tex, type=tex,
pattern=amsldoc (normal), configuration = completely new
* Close files after opening... --> crash!
FIXED:
* wrong Menu caption (File/Open Recent was changed to File/Recent)

============================================================== [200508]

#66/fixed/kyanh/20050824/
* Report: Stew Heckenberg <whazaaaaahp at hotmail.com>
* Data: winefish.desktop.in: Execute 'winefish -n' without parameter

#65/fixed/kyanh/unknown/
* Hilight: \itemsep: only \item is higlighted

============================================================== [200507]

#64/fixed/kyanh/20050723/
* Advance Openning failed.
FIXED:
document.c::files_advanced_win_ok_clicked()
After finishing, we donot free the 'temp_file',
as we did it in remove_secure_dir_and_filename();

#63/not-a-bug/
* Open a project, close it, open again, close again,...
* Open 'faqbody.tex' (12 651 lines, 553kb), close, open, close,...

	that is not a gtk issue, but a Linux issue. On Linux, if you
	malloc(1000000000) and then free() that same block, your program still
	uses those 1000000000 bytes, they are not returned to the operating
	system (but they will be swapped out if you don't use them)

#62/fixed/kyanh/20050719/
* Open Winefish, open a project, close the project,
then open then close again ==> there is a untitled document
with empty scroll [ empty textview area ]
FIXED:
gui.c::notebook_changed()
	bfwin->current_document = doc_new(bfwin,delay_activate = FALSE);

document.c::doc_new()
	if ( !delay_activate )
		gtk_widget_show( newdoc->view );
	/*
	@delay_activate: Delay _show() if neccessary
	Whether to perform GUI-calls and flush_queue().
	Set to TRUE when loading several documents at once.
	*/

#61
* Closing a project [within new Winefish window] should close
also the Winefish window

#60
* Cannot open project's files at specific linenumber

#59/fixed/kyanh/20050719/
* See project with files A, B, C (A is the first one)
The BUG may be generated like this:
	- open in Winefish the file A
	- open the project
(a)
/fixed/kyanh/20050719/05:58 GMT +7
	We may see that the files A, B, C are opened...
	But there is also an Untitled document :((
	
	If we open the file B first, nothing special occurs.
(b)
/fixed/kyanh/20050719/
	There is also a Gtk-Critical **: \
		gtk_text_layout_get_iter_location: \
		assertion `GTK_IS_TEXT_LAYOUT (layout)' failed

#58/fixed/kyanh/20050718/
* Open project, then close it...? What's wrong? The value of view_bars
(global session) is*NOT* restored. This mean that: the setting of 'View/*'
will be kept after exiting a project.
FIXED:
see 'project.c'

#57[major]/fixed/kyanh/20050718/
* Major BUG: Preferences / AutoX: the memories are*NOT* freed
==> each time Preferences are called, the memory used by Winefish
increase. Thanks to 'top -u kyanh -d 00.10' :)
FIXED:
use (g_list_find), not (g_list_find_custom) in
updating list of items of 'main_v->completion'

#56/fixed/kyanh/20050717/
* command collector cannot add the command \eval.
Why? because in the 'main_v->props.completion' there are times
which are prefixed by '\eval'...
FIXED:
in previous coding, i checked for existing of '\eval'
using 'g_completion_complete'. This means that: if an item can be
completed by 'main_v->completion', the item will*NOT* be added to
the session list.

#55/fixed/kyanh/20050716/
* After updating the autocompletion list [ using Preferences Page ],
the completion_list is*NOT* sorted ==> bad completion behavior.
FIXED:
use the function (g_list_insert_sorted) while updating the list.
See 'src/preferences.c' for details.

#54[major]/fixed/kyanh/20050719/04:04 GMT +7
* Open a file [ that belongs to a project ]
Open the project contains that file ==> wrong:
	- the file will be removed from first window
	- and opened in the second window
	- but with the empty file name. So strange :((
	- the 'close' icon for new doc disappears

#53[wf-1.3.2-5]/fixed/kyanh/20050714/
* \label{} for image wizard doesnot work
This is wrong *only* for wf 1.3.2-5 ... after i made some changes

#52
* (doc_insert_two_string) sometimes inserts extra spaces to (after_str).

#51
* Copy and Paste: \n\r will produce two lines
The hilight is incorrect if there's some \r.

#50[major]/fixed/kyanh/20050716/
* External Tool: "cat" is too slow :(
Why? Because of scrolling the output.

#49/fixed/kyanh/20050714/
* autocompletion: if the result contains 1 command, it should disappear

#48/fixed/kyanh/20050713/
* tex hilight: \right. doesnot work

============================================================== [200506]

#47/fixed/kyanh/20050704/
* Outputbox: too slow. May be decrease the value of interval.
I used the value of 20000 :D

#46/fixed/kyanh/200507xx/
* Error occurs... if we close winefish before any tools finished :)
So you have to cleanup the outputbox ... before exit:D 
See CVS history for details. I fixed this but forgot to put comment here.
[Today is 20050712]

#45[major]/fixed/kyanh/20050706/
/fixed/kyanh/20050704/
* Running Outputbox (after the tool exists): the systesm resources will
be*NOT* freed ==> more and more resources are needed.

#44/fixed/kyanh/20050703/
* The Main GUI is*NOT* activated ... when called from xdvi.

#43/fixed/kyanh/20050627/
* Outputbox: zoombie tools arenot cleaned up

#42/fixed/kyanh/20050627/
* Cannnot build on FreeBSD (kill is explicit declaration; SIGKILL is undeclared)

#41/partial/fixed/kyanh/20050307/
* Open Winefish (winefish document.c -l20). When the main/doc gui appear,
close Winefish immediately => crashes

#40/fixed/kyanh/20050619/
* make uninstall will
	rm -f /usr/share/pixmaps/bluefish-icon.png
Sorry Bluefish team :((
Fixed: Edit the Makefile.in

#39
* Image Wizard: image too large ==> wrong scaling

#38/fixed/kyanh/20050619/
* if there is image/newdoc/ dialog opened while wf exits ==> crash

#37/fixed/kyanh/20050619/
* "Insert/Image/Browser" generates the following message:

(a) backend = gnome-vfs
	(winefish:850): libgnomevfs-CRITICAL **: \

(b) backend = localonly
	(winefish:339): Gtk-CRITICAL **: \

	if ( g_path_is_absolute(setfile) ) {/* valid setfile, BUGS#37 */
		gtk_file_chooser_set_filename(GTK_FILE_CHOOSER(dialog),setfile);
	}

#36/fixed/20050718/
* Open a file. The Open a project. The the "View/*" sub menu will accept
the value from parents (view=1), but the wigdets arenot showed (by settings
from Project properties).... How to repeat this error?
FIXED:
See 'project.c'

#35/do-not-implement/
* Using "\r" in "autotext" will not start autoindent :)

#34/fixed/kyanh/20050619/
* project template: doesnot work :(

#33/fixed/kyanh/20050618/
* "Auto Close LaTeX tags" ==> "Auto close environment"

#32/fixed/kyanh/20050618/
* Autotext is*NOT* indented automatically.

#31/fixed/kyanh/20050618/
* "Environment Autoclosing" is*NOT* indented automatically.

#30/fixed/kyanh/200506xx/
* "New Document" Wizard:
If we use this wizard to generate a new latex document,
in tetex 3.0, the result of typesetting this document will be a PDF file
(no matter we try *latex* or *pdflatex*)
The reason is: we used \pdfoutput=1. Just remove this line from template.
...
must use:
 \ifx\pdfoutput\undefined\relax\else\ifnum\pdfoutput=1\relax\pdftrue\fi\fi

#29
* New document doesnot update hilight :(( -- Must do it by hand.

============================================================== [200504]

#28/ingored/
* Winefish cannot escaped from infinite loop [suspend]
I am sorry that i cannot repeat this bug on the system.

#27/fixed/kyanh/2005xxxx/
* \label must be followed \caption :D

#26/invalid/unikey-gtk/
* Autocompletion if failed should remove the last space.
This bug relates only to UniKeyGTK input method for Vietnamese.
I contacted UnikeyGTK's Author but he was being busy.

============================================================== [200503]

#25/fixed/kyanh/20050322/
* When the outputbox is hidden, Menu View/ViewOutputbox mustbe untoggled.

#24/fixed/kyanh/20050321/
* The outputbox should be shown the tool called.

#23/fixed/kyanh/20050320/
* LeftPanel/FileBrowsers: after being hiding, the document focus losts
Fix:
	gui.c::left_panel_show_hide_toggle()
		...
		if (!first_time) {
			...
			gtk_widget_grab_focus(bfwin->current_document->view);
		}

#22/fixed/kyanh/20050317/
* Outputbox: if user closes it by clicking on the 'X' image,
the the toggle menu 'View/View Outputbox' isnot set to 'FALSE'
Fix:
	Modified outputbox.c::outputbox_close_clicked_lcb()

#21/fixed/kyanh/20050316/
* Autotext: wrong backwards. If we have /kyanh => Ky` Anh:La'u Ta'u (utf8)
the result of autotext replacement is "Ky`A:nhLau'Ta'u" (: is the cursor)
Fix:
	use g_utf8_strlen(foo,-1), not strlen(foo)

#20/fixed/kyanh/20050316/
* External Tools: LaTeX: return 250 for the file
	~/tex/vntex/doc/generic/vntex/README.tex
Once it halted.
Fix:
	In outputbox.c, we should use
		g_io_channel_set_encoding(ob->io_channel,NULL,NULL);
	Capture the io_error, we got:
		Invalid byte sequence in conversion input
	After use NULL as encoding, we are safe in dealing with binary data.

#19/fixed/kyanh/20050316/
* Clean Tool: if we add the clean-tool like this
	rm -fv '%b.{log,aux,...}'
Winefish will crash. NOTE: the bash expandsion ({}) cannot be placed
in the couple of ' or ". I donot know why.... Hmm, if "rm -fv " fails,
Winefish will crash too. Trying "xterm -e rm -fv ..." failed too.
Fix:
	Not really a fix.
	Running cleanning tool causes often the message
		"interrupted system call"
	=> should try the call again.

#18
* Undo: will move cursor to the first iterator. Should be the last...

#17/not-a-bug/
* Running "External Tool" on "Untitled Document" will make Winefish crashed.
	Because of some reason, I <kyanh@o2.pl> cannot use GTK_file_chooser
	on my system. This is very very strange. As the thing is normal when
	i login as root account. [GTK 2.4.3 (distribute by Slackware 10.0)]

#16/fixed/kyanh/20050313/
* GTK_CRITICAL: using quickstart dialogs will emmit
Fix:
	"assertion GTK_IS_TEXT_BUFFER failed."
	
	We used
		wizards::quickstart::doc_insert_two_string(doc, pointer, "foo").
	It should be
		wizards::quickstart::doc_insert_two_string(doc, pointer, g_strdup("foo")).
	This is hard to imagine.
	Because the function ::doc_insert_two_string() has the prototype
		doc_insert_two_strings(...,const gchar *before_str, const gchar *after_str)
	Using this function in html.c::*, we don't encounter any problem.
	May the length of *after_string be too long?
	
#15
* Bad "document.c::doc_insert_two_strings()"
	Previous version of winefish based on "bluefish 013" works very well.
	I tried but failed on fixing this problem. May I check the CVS version
	of Bluefish. I am sorry :)

#15/fixed/kyanh/20050313/
* Tools:
	Tools require the pipe files created in working directory.
	So if current working is*NOT* writable, TOOLs will stop with message:
		"> Error: cannot create PIPE"
Fix:
	We should create the temporary files in /tmp/
	The function bf_lib.c::create_secure_dir_return_filename() was re-written.

#14
* FileBrowsers: click on a pipe will make Winefish suspend.
	Hope that you will never have a chance of clicking on a PIPE :)

#13/done/kyanh/20050301/
* DVIPDFM:: Outputbox cannot scroll to the end of message
Fix:
	Do *NO* thing -- completely.
	I don't know why outputbox for DVIPDFM cannot scroll this morning.
	Now it works very well [20050301-23:05]

#12/fixed/kyanh/20050301/[M. Garoche, 20050301]
* For Mac OS: <wait.h> should be replaced by <sys/wait.h>

/done/kyanh/20050301/
* <signal.h> should be followed <sys/types.h>
	<signal.h> should be removed from otuputbox.c. We don't use kill() anymore
	See $man signal
	
* "malloc.h" is*NOT* recognized

#11/fixed/kyanh/20050301/[Larry Nguyen, M. Garoche, 20050301]

	Shouldnot use g_free(ext);

#10/fixed/kyanh/20060124/
* For 'outputbox.c': Doubleclick to open file => may open
	two vesion of a same file (for e.g:
		foo/foo.tex
		./foo/foo.tex
	Winefish treats that two files as two different files.
	)
* Repeat:
	~/tmp/vidu1/vidu0.tex (which includes ~/tmp/testinput.tex)
	document.c::documentlist_return_document_from_filename
FIXED:
	use `stat' to check for `inodes'. previous version use `strcmp'
	to compare filename (stupid). latest bluefish uses gnome_vfs_uri_equal'

#9/found/kyanh/20050306/

	Using Slackware, i don't package depencies anymore.
	Is it true that GTK requires GNOMEUI?
	Answer:
		GTK requires GNOME-VFS??? NO!
Fix:
	chmod 755 /home/
	File_chooser will be tedious if perm(/home) = 711
